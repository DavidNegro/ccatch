# Experimental Catch2-like Test Framework for C

This is a header-only unit testing framework for C, inspired by Catch2.

I built it just for fun â€” DO NOT USE.

See `unit_test.c` & `unit_impl.c` as an usage example.

Only tested in Windows with msvc.

To create the amalgamated header, run a developer command prompt (or run the
`scripts/developer_cmd.ps1` prompt script) and run `scripts/build.bat`
